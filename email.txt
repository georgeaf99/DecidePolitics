Hello Erica,

We really enjoyed building out an MVP for PolitiHack at the Bay Area Hackathon.
After the event we started discussing the feature set we would need to create
a sustainable product. We believe that the key value of our product is making
politics simple and palatable for the average citizen. In order to further
this goal we want to put a heavy emphasis on content that we push out to users
i.e. sending them info about important bills being passed. Additionally, we want
to close the loop by including an SMS voter registration system, the first of
its kind. We have done some research and found that 30 states, including
California, have implemented online voter registration systems which we believe
can be used to register voters through our platform. This goal may be difficult
to navigate, so we are looking for mentorship from someone with experience in
this area.

Additionally, we think that PolitiHack could help to round out LinkedIn's
value proposition. There is already a great deal of political content shared
on the platform daily, and LinkedIn's content discovery team seems up to the
challenge of curating political content. If we are able to get traction on with
this product, we think the next step could involve porting it to LinkedIn.

Thanks much,
George
